<h1>Notes for ICML 2015</h1>

LÃ©on Bottou, Facebook Research
------------------------------
Two Big Challenges in Machine Learning:

---- RBC: why must we utilize big data to solve simple things?  why not take advantage of all of a little bit of data.

Elements of a solution
Engineering process - what should the ML engineering process be
Scientific process - need ad hoc experimentation instead of just training/test experiments
Demand that authors discus the limits of the topic discussed in papers.

ML with stronger contracts - optimze measure of coverage instead of average accuracy.
interesting property when data is ZipF distributed.

packaging the work of others in ML
replicate training or reusing trained data.
