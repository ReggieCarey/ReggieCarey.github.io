multivariate gausians

HMM

$$Nu(x|mu,sigma^2)=$$

forward backward algorithm as a tool for compiting marginals p(x(t) | y(1),...y(tau))

Vector autoregressive (VAR) process

$$ y_t = \sum^r_i=1 A_iy_{t-i}+e_t$$

Stationary VAR processes


State Space Models

Like HMM but continuous valued lated state sequence

$$x_t = Ax_{t-1} + e{t}$$
$$y_t = Cx_t + w_t

--------

VAR in state space form:

State space models are a superset of VAR processes

this is all setup for the discussion


Latent Factor Model



Look at Baysian Nonparameteric Clustering

adds additional k as new data available.
