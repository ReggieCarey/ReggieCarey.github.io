        <p>As we look at the world around us, we have immediate access to the composition of the visual scene into objects, as well
            as our relationship in space to those objects. Likewise, in listening to speech, we are aware of meaning, often without
            even paying attention to the words themselves. This natural facility makes it possible to move though the world, catch
            or avoid moving objects, and base immediate decisions on a detailed understanding of the world around us. Only
            secondarily might we note the particular color or composition of particular points in the visual scene, or the durations
            of certain vowel sounds, or other low-level visual or auditory features of the scene. Our brain processes sensory
            information much differently than computers do: a computer can easily store the hue and luminance of every pixel of an
            image, but even with the best available software it cannot parse an arbitrary natural image into its underlying
            elements.</p>

    With SelfAttention class we assume the input to be transformed into query, key, value vectors

    This implementation can operate in the multihead regime.  The trick is to change the dimensionality of
    query, key, and value by prefixing a dimension for the number of selfAttention heads.  The result is a tensor
